3 Things Apple Inc. Earnings Revealed About the iPad
Last quarter, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-suffering iPad business did something magical: It returned to growth after what seemed like an endless streak of both unit and revenue declines.Unit growth was quite impressive, at 15% year over year, although revenue growth was just 2%, as the unit growth appears to have been driven by the introduction of the low-cost 9.7-inch iPad.On the company's conference call accompanying its financial results, management talked quite a bit about the iPad business.Here are three key things from that discussion that I think investors should know.CEO Tim Cook said on the call that the iPad business enjoyed "broad-based growth in units, revenue, and market share." "iPad sales were up 15% year over year and grew across all of our geographic segments," he added.The comment vis-a-vis growth across all geographic segments was interesting because back in Apple's fiscal second quarter, the company reported iPad segment growth in the U.S. and "revenue growth worldwide for [Apple's] 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters."In fiscal second quarter, the first glimmers of hope for the iPad segment emerged, and in fiscal third quarter, the iPad showed an unequivocal return to revenue and unit growth.Furthermore, Cook says that Apple "achieved [its] highest global market share in over four years based on [research firm] IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter."CFO Luca Maestri also provided some data points around iPad market share.Citing data from NPD, he said that "iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the month of June, including 8 of the 10 best-selling tablets.""That's up from 46% share a year ago," he continued.Now, as investors are likely aware, Apple doesn't compete across the entire spectrum of tablets; it competes in the market for tablets priced at $329 and up. "Among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 89%," Maestri said about iPad's share in the U.S.So, it's quite clear that Apple's tablet revenue share is quite a bit higher than its pure unit share due to the much higher and typical average selling prices of iPad products (even Apple's so-called "low-cost" 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $329) relative to competing devices.One area that the iPad originally found success in was the education market. However, in recent years, iPad has faced significant competition from low-cost notebooks (particularly from Chromebooks, which are low-cost notebook computers that run the free Chrome OS, which helps to drive down system prices due to the lack of a need for a pricey Windows license).It would seem, though, that Apple has found its footing in this battle. Cook said on the call that its "iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales were up 32% year over year to 1 million units."It's very likely that the more affordable price point of the new 9.7-inch iPad helped Apple quite a lot in growing its sales into the education market.Well done, Apple.
This Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Leak Looks Ridiculously Impressive
On social media, known leaker Ice Universe leaked what appear to be some tidbits about the A11 Fusion processor that is slated to power Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone models slated for launch this fall.Per the leaker, here are some tidbits about the upcoming chip:Although this information, if true, doesn't seem like a lot, it tells us quite a lot about the innovations that Apple plans to bring to the new chip -- at least with respect to the CPU portion of the chip (the CPU is a critical part of the user experience).Let's assume this information is true and then go over what it means for the new iPhone models and how it compares to last year's A10 Fusion chip.The Apple A10 Fusion chip runs its "high-performance cores" at a frequency of 2.34GHz. At that speed, the A10 Fusion achieves a single-core Geekbench 4 score of roughly 3500 -- making it best in class among smartphones today, and even putting it in direct competition with modern notebook and desktop personal computers.If the A11 Fusion chip runs its high-performance cores at 3GHz, then this would imply a frequency uplift of about 28%. The single-core Geekbench 4 score that Ice Universe claims the A11 Fusion can achieve in the best case is 4600, or about 31% better than what the A10 Fusion could achieve.It would seem to me, then, that in terms of the "high-performance cores," the bulk of the performance gain comes from the cores achieving a significantly higher operating frequency than the previous generation design rather than in boosting the amount of work the CPU cores do per clock speed.Such a dramatic increase in frequency likely comes partly from the transition to a new, higher performance manufacturing technology, and partly from circuit-level enhancements.In other words, Apple's chip team has been working hard.The leaker also claims that the A11 Fusion chip will support a feature known as "heterogeneous multi-processing."At first, I was inclined to think the leaker was merely referring to Apple's "Fusion" scheme whereby it uses two "high-performance" cores to run processor-intensive tasks (e.g., games) while using two "high-efficiency" cores to handle less intensive/mundane tasks (e.g., email).However, heterogeneous multi-processing is a term that's used to refer to a processor setup whereby both the "high-performance" cores as well as the "high-efficiency" cores can be used in tandem to increase performance (albeit at the cost of additional power consumption).If Apple is indeed implementing such a scheme, that could help boost the peak multi-core performance of the A11 Fusion chip relative to what it'd be able to do under the prior scheme used by the A10 Fusion and A10X Fusion.And, finally, while I talked about the single-core Geekbench 4 score, the multi-core scores that Ice Universe posted seems to imply that there will only be two high-performance cores present on the chip.Apple's A10X Fusion, which showed up in the company's recently launched iPad Pro 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch tablets, includes three high-performance cores and three high-efficiency cores. However, by the larger device surface area and battery capacity of the iPad Pro tablets relative to the upcoming iPhone models, the A10X Fusion can consume more power and dissipate more heat than the A11 Fusion will be allowed to.Therefore, it only makes sense that Apple would stick with two high-performance cores and try to wring more performance out of them for the A11 Fusion rather than try to stuff three of each in there, only to have the device overheat or battery life severely shortened.
