This Apple Inc. iPhone "Super Cycle" Could Have Staying Power
When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus back in late 2014, it triggered what's now called a "super cycle." Essentially, the pace at which users within the iPhone installed base upgraded to Apple's freshest iPhone models accelerated to well beyond traditional levels because of the introduction of large-screen iPhones.However, Apple's subsequent product cycles -- the iPhone 6s-series and iPhone 7-series cycles, -- failed to drive the kind of upgrade activity that the iPhone 6-series did.During Apple's fiscal 2016, the company saw iPhone unit shipments drop 8% year over year, with iPhone revenue dropping an even wider 12%. The implied compression in average year-over-year selling prices was no doubt due to the introduction of the low-cost iPhone SE and its buoying of shipments. Over the first three quarters of Apple's current fiscal year, iPhone revenue has grown 4% and units grew 2% from the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. This is obviously a welcome improvement, but Apple's iPhone business is still currently below where it was during the iPhone 6 cycle.This year, Apple's trio of new smartphones -- the iPhone 7s, the 7s Plus, and the premium iPhone with OLED display, commonly referred to as the iPhone 8 or iPhone X -- are expected to supercharge Apple's iPhone growth and, in effect, engender another so-called "super cycle."Here's why I think, unlike what happened during fiscal 2016, Apple's "super cycle" could span not just this coming iPhone generation but the next one as well.The iPhone 7s and 7s Plus should be relatively straightforward updates to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively, with only the premium OLED iPhone delivering a big change in form factor as well as the addition of other radical new features, such as, perhaps, 3-D sensing or Face ID. The OLED model is also expected to be sold at a premium to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, while the latter two will presumably be sold at the traditional price points.What this could all mean for Apple is that it enjoys a sizable super-cycle this year because of the ramp-up of the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and, of course, the OLED iPhone. Then, in the following cycle, Apple would go from having two "mature" designs and one "fresh" one to a three-phone lineup, all with advanced OLED displays and other goodies.This approach would make more advanced iPhone technology more affordable, which could further catalyze upgrades and drive robust sales growth for another product cycle.In fact, while this coming product cycle should be a story of both an uplift in the average selling price and a solid amount of unit growth, the following cycle could be characterized by relatively stable average selling prices as well as an acceleration in unit shipments.The next two iPhone product cycles have the potential to be quite nice for Apple and could ultimately serve to enrich the company and its stockholders. 
Apple Inc.'s OLED iPhone 8 Display Tough to Manufacture
In just a month or so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to formally unveil its latest iPhone models. Among them is expected to be a "premium" iPhone with a full-face OLED display, as well as other goodies that many expect will help boost the company's iPhone business, which is by far the company's largest and most important.Per a social media post from a Foxconn executive (Foxconn is believed to be the contract manufacturer responsible for the assembly of the upcoming OLED iPhone models), the yield rates on the OLED display that Apple plans to fit the new phones with is super hard to make.Let's take a closer look at the details.The executive reportedly said in the social media post (it's in Chinese, and I can't read Chinese, so I'm relying on second-hand translations of the now-deleted tweet) that the manufacturing yield rate of the OLED iPhone's display is just 60%.OLED displays are already inherently more expensive than LCDs because of several factors, not the least of which is the simple fact that there's only one supplier that can reportedly meet Apple's stringent quality/performance demands -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF).By contrast, there are several manufacturers of the more common liquid crystal display (LCD) technology that's used in Apple's current iPhone models (and is expected to be employed in this year's iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus). This means greater competition, lower margin for the suppliers, and therefore lower component costs for Apple.The yield rate is reportedly negatively impacted by the "notch" design of the display (a portion of the display is cut out to allow the camera sensors and speaker to poke through).However, I doubt that it's just the "notch" that's driving the yields of these displays down. Apple's displays, particularly recently, offer exceptionally good performance in terms of viewing angles, color accuracy, and brightness.Additionally, Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is planning to add high-refresh rate displays to its iPhone models this year, so this will add further complexity to the display manufacturing process. Apple likely wants to raise the display performance bar with this year's OLED iPhone models, which is certainly good from a user experience perspective, but such stringent quality demands will probably make it so that many of the panels that come off the line that'd be "good enough" for most smartphone vendors simply won't cut it for Apple.So, I firmly believe that it's the combination of Apple's pursuit of exceptional mobile display performance, coupled with the novel "notch" design, that's keeping a lid on the manufacturing yields and is therefore driving display manufacturing costs up.The good news is that the OLED iPhone isn't expected to be the company's only new iPhone model this year; it's meant to be a lower volume, higher-priced product.That said, many Apple customers seem to be willing to pay more to get more (as Apple's strong iPhone 7 Plus performance seems to have proven), so demand for the higher-priced OLED iPhone should still be quite robust.This means that neither Apple nor Samsung can afford to rest on their laurels, and I expect them to work hard to improve the yield rates of the OLED display over time. Not only will improved yield rates lead to better supply, but it'd also lower display manufacturing costs, which should ultimately help Apple's gross profit margin percentage.
