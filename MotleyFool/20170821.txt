Apple Inc. Sticks by iPad
Last quarter, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad business -- after suffering a long string of declines -- returned to growth; unit shipments were up 15% year-over-year and revenue was up 2% year-over-year.That's not awe-inspiring growth, but if you consider that Apple's iPad unit shipments were still -- even after last quarter's performance -- down 8% year-over-year over the company's last three quarters (revenue performance was worse at down 10% in that time) -- it's an encouraging start.I think that Apple's iPad business has a real chance of delivering sustained, if rather modest, growth over the long-term, even if the overall tablet market remains weak.Here's why.When Apple's iPad was growing like crazy, virtually every smartphone maker seemed desperate to try to get a piece of the tablet action.That's not terribly surprising, as industry analysts published some rather impressive forecasts for where the tablet market was headed during the heat of the craze. Research firm IDC, for example, predicted in 2012 that in 2017, more than 352 million tablets would be shipped industry wide.In February, IDC said that in 2016, worldwide tablet shipments came in at just 174.8 million -- down nearly 16% from 2015 levels.That 2012 forecast missed by a mile.Considering a worse-than-expected tablet market, many tablet vendors have cut back their investments in the product category, if not outright exited the market. Additionally, many of the remaining vendors appear locked in a race-to-the-bottom, with the focus being on cost rather than on innovation at higher price points.Apple has, of course, begun to participate somewhat in this race-to-the-bottom by introducing its relatively low-cost 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $329 for the base model. Unlike its competitors, though, Apple hasn't taken its foot off the gas in terms of iPad technology innovation.Apple still develops applications processors tailored specifically to the needs and relaxed thermal/power constraints of its high-end iPad line; Apple's competition in the premium portion of the tablet market still use smartphone applications processors for their models.Apple also brings new technologies to its iPad line first, including True Tone display technology with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, as well as ProMotion display technology with this year's 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models.Additionally, Apple seems to be doubling down on building iPad-specific features into its iOS operating system, rather than redirecting its research and development efforts elsewhere.All this indicates that Apple is thinking about iPad for the long term, rather than about the category in terms of the kind of near-term financial return that it'll drive.To the extent that the tablet market continues to exist, I'm confident that Apple will soak up an increasing share of unit shipments, revenue dollars, and margin dollars.Part of that is because Apple keeps treating the iPad as a first-class citizen, and part of that is simply due to the fact that the company's "competitors" can't be bothered to try to seriously compete with the iPad.
Apple Inc.'s Huge Growth Opportunity
Although many investors like to focus on some of the new market opportunities that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ahead of it, such as Apple Watch and its services business, there's still plenty of opportunity for the company to grow its largest and most important business: iPhone.On Apple's most recent earnings call, one analyst -- seemingly in an attempt to gauge Apple's view of this opportunity -- asked the company's management about the potential for smartphone market share gains.Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to give any specific guidance on Apple's market share plans, but he did indicate that he does expect the company to be able to grow its iPhone market share out in time.Here's how Apple can do it, what kind of market share Apple could reasonably expect to gain, and what such gains could ultimately mean for the company.A new report from Strategy Analytics (via GizmoChina) claims that during the second calendar quarter of the year, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) shipped 10.2 million Galaxy S8 smartphones and 9 million Galaxy S8+ smartphones, for a total of 19.2 million phones.Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus maintained sizable leads over their Samsung-made counterparts, shipping 16.9 million and 15.1 million units, per the report -- an impressive showing considering that the Galaxy S8-series launched in the second quarter of 2017 while the iPhone 7-series came out at the end of the third quarter of 2016.I strongly suspect that Apple has an opportunity to eat into Samsung's flagship Galaxy S-series smartphone shipments beginning with this year's iPhone models -- and beyond. Here's how.Smartphone aesthetics and -- at least the perception of -- technological superiority both matter to a portion of the smartphone buying public. I suspect that this is particularly true among those that purchase flagship smartphones like the iPhone and the Galaxy S-series of devices.Over the last two generations -- that is, during the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 generations -- Apple has fielded phones that, if we're being honest, looked nearly identical to the iPhone 6-series that launched in 2014.By contrast, Samsung has been making larger strides in the form factor/aesthetics of its devices. The Galaxy S5 looked rather cheap compared to, say, the iPhone 5s, but beginning with the Galaxy S6, Samsung arguably began to pull ahead in terms of aesthetics.The Galaxy S6 featured a glass back (which some think looks more "premium" than the aluminum unibody of the iPhone 6/6s/7-series devices), the Galaxy S7 came in an "Edge" variant with an edge-to-edge display that wrapped around the sides.Then, with the Galaxy S8, Samsung introduced a display that not only retained that slick curved edge-to-edge display, but it introduced a "full face" display as well that nearly eliminated the bezels.With this year's premium OLED iPhone, Apple has a real opportunity to pull over the kinds of customers that value aesthetics, as the device is rumored to adopt a glass back as well as a nearly bezel-free full-face OLED design.Apple is rumored to have tested out a curved display, but that simply wasn't viable for this year's iPhone models. However, if Apple can deliver on a sharp, beautiful, and potentially even fast (with ProMotion) OLED display this year, then Apple will not only have "caught up" with Samsung (and others), but it'll be in the pole position vis-à-vis aesthetics.That aesthetic leadership, coupled with technology leadership, brand strength, and the robustness of its software and services ecosystem, should allow Apple to capture significant share of the high-end smartphone market from Samsung and others.Then, once Apple has established such leadership, should it continue to innovate faster and, frankly, better than others (something that Apple's huge research and development budget is clearly dedicated to doing), then it should be looking at years of sustained premium smartphone market share growth.
