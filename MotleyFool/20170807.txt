2 Things Apple Inc. Earnings Revealed About the Mac
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) let its Mac line of personal computers languish for a while, which drove some market share losses for the company.However, Apple came back strong with a refreshed lineup of MacBook Pro computers last fall, which helped the company's Mac business return to revenue and unit shipment growth, as well as market segment share gains.In Apple's most recent quarter, the company's Mac business continued its renewed winning streak, no doubt fueled by a refresh of much of its Mac lineup at its annual World Wide Developers Conference.Here are two things that Apple's earnings results, in tandem with comments from management on the accompanying conference call with analysts , revealed about Apple's Mac business.Apple reported that its Mac business enjoyed revenue of nearly $5.6 billion on almost 4.3 million units shipped. Mac unit shipments were up 1% year over year, while revenue was up 7% year over year, suggesting that the company enjoyed average selling price growth .Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that based on the company's Mac shipment numbers in the quarter, coupled with data about the overall personal computer market from research firm IDC -- a 4% decline, according to CEO Tim Cook -- the company gained personal computer market share during the quarter.Maestri also said this performance in the Mac business was "thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro."It wouldn't be surprising to learn that the MacBook Pro made up a larger mix of Apple's overall Mac business in the quarter, which helped drive Apple's Mac average selling prices up.The lesson from Apple's multi-quarter winning streak in the Mac is simple yet powerful: Consistently refreshing a product line, particularly one that faces intense competition, is critical to good business performance.Another metric that Apple often talks about is customer satisfaction for its various product lines. Citing work by research firm 451 Research, Maestri said that Mac customer satisfaction "is very strong at 97%."A high level of customer satisfaction is important for two big reasons.First, the personal computer market relies heavily on customers replacing their old personal computers every so often. If the individuals who currently have Macs are generally satisfied with their products (97% satisfaction rate indicates such), then they're more likely to buy another Mac when the time comes to upgrade their computers.Furthermore, those same customers may have some influence on the personal computer purchasing decisions of friends and family members. If current Mac owners are happy with their devices, then they're more likely to recommend them to these friends and family.Then, if those customers are happy with their products, they could potentially sway their friends and family members to go with Macs. And once those individuals buy Macs, they could bring multiple generations' worth of business and influence even more individuals to buy Macs.Assuming the data from 451 Research is representative of the customer satisfaction rate among the general Mac user population, Apple's Mac business should be in good shape.
Inside Apple Inc.'s Greater China Results
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its financial results on Aug. 1 and released its accompanying quarterly filing (form 10-Q) just a day later.In that filing, Apple gave quite a lot of detail beyond what the earnings press release provided and served to further supplement the commentary that management provided on the earnings call.In the filing, Apple provides some information about its performance in the Greater China region.Apple's performance in the Greater China region has been of great interest to investors for quite some time, particularly as it is an area that was once (and may continue to be) seen as potentially fueling Apple's iPhone growth for years to come.The Greater China region is populous and, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has brought up repeatedly, the region continues to see robust growth in its middle class.A larger middle class means -- at least, in theory -- that the slice of the population that can afford Apple's relatively pricey iPhones is growing, translating into a bigger opportunity for Apple.In fiscal year 2015 -- the year of the iPhone 6 series -- Apple enjoyed 84% year-over-year revenue growth in the Greater China region, with sales surging from $31.85 billion in the previous fiscal year to an eye-popping $58.71 billion. That year, sales to Greater China made up 25% of Apple's revenue, up from 17% in the year prior. In fiscal year 2016 -- the year of the ill-fated iPhone 6s series -- revenue tumbled to just $48.5 billion.That figure was still up substantially from the figure that Apple saw in fiscal year 2014, but a double-digit revenue loss was clearly a cause for concern.During fiscal year 2017, Apple has continued to suffer in the Greater China region. In the first quarter of the year, revenue from Greater China slumped by 12% year over year, followed by a 14% drop in the following quarter.In its most recent quarter, Apple reported a 10% year-over-year dip in Greater China revenue -- a slight improvement from its performance in the region over the last two quarters.Apple says in its quarterly filing that the drop over both the prior quarter as well as the decrease in Greater China in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 relative to the revenue seen from the region in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was "due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by growth in net sales of services."The company also blamed "weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar" for having an "unfavorable impact" on the revenue that Apple saw in the region last quarter.It's clear that the iPhone 7 series, as well as its prior-generation iPhone 6s series, simply didn't resonate in the region, particularly as other, local smartphone manufacturers in the Greater China region like Vivo, OPPO, and Huawei have enjoyed robust growth there.I think Apple's problems really come down to its products. Many of the local Chinese vendors offer phones with top-tier specifications, interesting industrial designs, and "fair" price points for what they offer.That's not to put down the iPhone 7 series from a technical/feature perspective -- those devices are best in class in several important ways, both in terms of hardware as well as in the software that runs on the hardware.However, Apple made the critical mistake of offering up what was largely the same basic smartphone shape for three generations in a row, even as its competition began doing some quite interesting things with their own flagship devices.Later this year, Apple is expected to launch an iPhone with an all-new design and some compelling new features like 3D facial recognition, a full-face OLED display, and souped-up internal specifications.If its Greater China results return to growth in the coming fiscal year, then my hypothesis that Apple's problem in the region was simply a product problem will be validated and the company will have a clear strategy to avoid suffering declines in the region for years to come.If they don't, then Apple's problems in Greater China may be much deeper, and much harder to solve, than they seem.
Big Apple Inc. iPhone 8 News Confirmed
About a month ago, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, whose track record in publishing details about upcoming Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products is quite good, predicted that Apple's upcoming iPhone with OLED display wouldn't include an in-display fingerprint sensor.A new note from Kuo, by way of AppleInsider, reportedly said Apple has made the decision to cut Touch ID out of the new iPhone -- something that, as AppleInsider points out, seems to be corroborated by a recent leak of future Apple product information from the firmware of Apple's upcoming HomePod smart speaker.At this point I think it's safe to say that Touch ID on the upcoming OLED iPhone isn't happening.It's widely believed at this point that the upcoming OLED iPhone will rely on a technology that some are calling Face ID to replace the venerable Touch ID technology, which made its debut on the iPhone 5s smartphone launched in September 2013.Noted Bloomberg tech reporter Mark Gurman recently said on social media that "Apple's pitch come September will be that Face ID is quicker, more secure, and more accurate than Touch ID.""People inside Apple say it is," Gurman added in his social-media post.Back in January, Kuo predicted (by way of MacRumors), based on "the bio-recognition patents that Apple has applied for," that Apple's long-term goal was for Touch ID to "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system."At the time, though, Kuo highlighted several potential technical challenges involved with shifting away from Touch ID to a facial-recognition technology."We note that the technical challenges of facial recognition include: (1) algorithms; (2) hardware design; and (3) the build-out of a database for verification and authentication, which could be time consuming," Kuo wrote back in January.If Apple has gotten Face ID to work properly on the upcoming iPhone -- that is, it fulfills the promise of being "quicker, more secure, and more accurate than Touch ID," as Gurman describes it -- then it's quite clear that the first and second technical challenges that Kuo brought up have been tackled.As far as "the build-out of a database for verification and authentication," I'm not entirely sure what Kuo means here. I don't think Apple would store facial data on a remote server in a "database."Perhaps what Kuo means is that the setup process for Face ID takes a lot more time than the setup process for Touch ID. That makes sense based on how Gurman described this Face ID technology in an article published last month."In testing, the face unlock feature takes in more data points than a fingerprint scan," Gurman said.If the system relies on more data points for the authentication process, then it'd surely need to take in more data points during the initial setup for the scan to deliver a safe, secure, and robust experience.It would've been nicer had Apple been able to augment Touch ID with Face ID, but as long as Apple can get Face ID working as intended, Touch ID may not be missed at all.
