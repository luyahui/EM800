Report: The Apple Inc. Watch Is Set to Keep Growing
A report published on Aug. 18 by DIGITIMES says that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track to ship 4.5 million Apple Watch units during the fourth quarter of the year, with shipments for the entire year coming in at 15 million units.The information, DIGITIMES says, comes from "sources in the upstream supply chain."Additionally, those same sources tell DIGITIMES that they expect Apple Watch shipments in 2018 to grow to 20 million units, up 33% year-over-year."With the third-generation device expected to feature updated apps and communication functionality, related shipments are expected to greatly boost Apple's overall smartwatch volumes," DIGITIMES says.It's not terribly surprising that feature and technology innovations are expected to drive growth, particularly for a product category that's still virtually in its infancy. At this point, I think it's safe to say that the Apple Watch has been, and continues to be, a success for the company. Apple wasn't first to the smartwatch market by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems to be totally dominating the market.In fact, the same DIGITIMES article says that although Apple Watch is doing well, Apple's competitors in the space "are seeing weakening demand for their wearable devices."Notably, the article says that Xiaomi and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) "are both seeing dropping sales for their smart bands," and that "smartwatch shipments from Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), LG Electronics, Huawei and Motorola remain weak."Fitbit, which specializes in fitness-oriented smart bands, reported revenue of $353 million last quarter, which was down almost 40% year-over-year. The company appears to be hoping that an entry into the smartwatch market proper (rather than just smart fitness bands) will help reverse its fortunes.Samsung has been in the smartwatch market for quite some time and has launched several generations of its Galaxy Gear line of smartwatches, though it appears to be enjoying minimal success with these products; per Strategy Analytics, Samsung shipped 2.4 million smartwatches in 2016, down from 2.7 million in 2015.Though Apple has seen rapid growth in this product category and is set to see solid growth in the coming year, the growth story for Apple Watch is likely far from over. If Apple can ramp annual shipments to 20 million next year after bringing just three generations of the device to market, then it seems reasonable to be optimistic that there's quite a lot of growth ahead for this product category -- at the very least, for Apple. As the connectivity capabilities as well as the processing power of the Apple Watch continue to grow -- and there's a lot of work that Apple still must do here -- so too will the uses for the device, which should help further boost adoption.Further, since there's plenty of room left for Apple to innovate (that's a nice way of saying that the current devices are still rather crude compared to what Apple Watches will look like and be able to do in just a few years), Apple should be able to drive a rather rapid upgrade cycle in the near-to-medium term.At the end of the day, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple achieve an annual run rate of 40-50 million Apple Watch shipments per year over the next five years, assuming that Apple continues to invest heavily in the product category in terms of both hardware and software capabilities and ecosystem.
3 Killer Specs to Expect From the Apple Inc. iPhone 9
In about a month's time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will likely unveil its next generation iPhone lineup, commonly referred to as the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 for the premium OLED display-packing variant.Though these phones all promise to be amazing pieces of technology -- and yes, if you're planning on buying the iPhone 8 on launch day, we're going to be competing for what's rumored to be limited initial quantities of the device -- the following year's iPhone models -- which I'll refer to as "iPhone 9" -- could bring big improvements along with several key feature vectors.Here are three killer features I expect from Apple's iPhone 9.Wi-Fi connectivity is a critical part of the smartphone user experience, and Apple's iPhones usually have great Wi-Fi subsystems. Per NotebookCheck.net's review of the iPhone 7 Plus, the phone delivered transfer rates described as "quite high compared to most Android rivals." The current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones support dual-stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi, with the chips provided by mobile Wi-Fi giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).On Aug. 15, Broadcom announced that it's sampling new chips based on the new 802.11ax Wi-Fi standard. Among those new chips was a chip called the BCM4375 aimed at the smartphone market, which supports dual-stream 802.11ax connectivity. In a nutshell, these new chips should enable dramatically faster Wi-Fi capabilities than the 802.11c chips that currently power the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.It's too early for Apple to incorporate the BCM4375 into this year's iPhone models. Broadcom is merely sampling them today, and there's usually a six-to-12-month period between when a component samples and when it's deployed in a commercially available product.However, I think that Apple will adopt the BCM4375 in the 2018 iPhone smartphones, which should mean dramatically improved Wi-Fi performance compared to this year's models.Another area where Apple is likely to deliver a big improvement in the 2018 iPhone models over this year's models is in cellular connectivity. Since Apple wants to dual-source cellular modems from market-leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), as well as challenger Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Apple must restrict the cellular capabilities of its Qualcomm-based smartphones to what Intel's current best modems are capable of.The XMM 7480 modem from Intel that Apple is likely to use in this year's iPhone models supports up to 600 megabits-per-second downlink speeds and 150 megabits-per-second uplink speeds. In other words, Intel will catch up this year with the capabilities that are present in the Qualcomm chips currently shipping inside of the iPhone 7-series phones, but are throttled back to normalize performance with the current XMM 7360-based iPhone 7-series phones.Next year, though, Intel is expected to introduce a new modem called the XMM 7560 that supports downlink speeds "exceeding 1Gbps" and uplink speeds of "up to 225Mbps" -- both substantial improvements over the capabilities that'll be present in this year's iPhone models. At the very least, Apple will be able to advertise a more than 67% improvement in downlink speeds and a 50% improvement in uplink speeds over cellular in the 2018 iPhone models compared to this year's models.Earlier this year, longtime Apple supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) announced that Apple no longer planned to incorporate its graphics intellectual properties into future Apple A-series applications processors. Apple went on to explain in a statement that it's dumping Imagination's technology in favor of in-house technology because it needs "unique and differentiating [intellectual property] for our products." Based on the timeline that Imagination has given vis-a-vis when it expects Apple to stop paying it royalty fees, it's clear that the Apple A12 Fusion processor, which should debut inside of the 2018 iPhone models, will have a custom-designed Apple graphics processor.I expect Apple to deliver something truly incredible with its own internal graphics processor, particularly given that Imagination's graphics technology has been, and continues to be, quite good. Expect Apple's 2018 iPhone models to have industry-leading graphics-processing capabilities.
Apple Inc.'s Brilliant Move
In about a month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to release a trio of new iPhones as well as a brand-new version of its iOS operating system, known as iOS 11.One thing that's quite interesting about iOS 11 is that it will totally remove support for 32-bit iOS applications -- from here on out, only 64-bit applications will be allowed in the Apple App Store.Although this might seem like something of an inconvenience for app developers, as well as for iOS users who want to upgrade to the new version of iOS and keep using 32-bit apps that the developers didn't bother to update, this is unequivocally a good thing for Apple's software ecosystem.One obvious effect of this new rule is that it'll go a long way to cleaning up the Apple App Store.Apple's iPhone has been around for about a decade now, and a lot of apps -- ranging from poor quality apps all the way to superb, highly polished software products -- are available in Apple's App Store.By mandating that all App Store apps be recompiled with 64-bit support, Apple weeds out apps that developers simply don't care about anymore, since recompiling the apps should be a downright trivial process for a developer that was able to get something published on the app store in the first place.That said, it's about far more than simply taking out the proverbial trash in the App Store.In going from the 32-bit ARMv7 architecture to the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, Apple delivered more performance to its customers, which is always a good thing.In testing that AnandTech performed back in 2013 when Apple introduced its first 64-bit processor (the Apple A7 chip) alongside a 64-bit version of its iOS 7 operating system, the site found that running the A7 chip in 64-bit mode delivered some big gains in the Geekbench 3 CPU benchmark.ARMv8 clearly improved things over ARMv7.Beyond that, a 64-bit processor can address far more memory than a 32-bit processor can; the latter is limited to just 4GB.In a world where Apple's flagship iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have 2GB and 3GB of memory, respectively, there's not exactly a pressing need for more than 4GB of memory today.But Apple's iPad Pro line of tablets are already at 4GB of memory with that figure sure to grow in the coming generation or two. Further, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Apple move its iPhone lines to include at least 4GB of memory (e.g. 4GB for the iPhone 7s successor; 6GB for the iPhone 7s Plus and OLED iPhone successors) in the following generation.Once that happens, it'll only be a few short product cycles before a large part of the iOS installed base will have phones with at least 4GB of memory. At that point, with all iOS apps being forced to be compiled with 64-bit support in mind, app developers can feel free to take advantage of the additional memory that those iPhones (as well as future generations of iPhones) will have.Apple's tight control of the hardware and software is paying off nicely, as it is allowing the company to go from introducing its first 64-bit smartphone in late 2013 to completely making obsolete its 32-bit iPhones just four years later.Now that's something only Apple can do. 
Why Apple, Inc. Should Go Big With Its Original Shows
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is about to drop $1 billion on original content over the next year, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The notable budget puts the tech giant alongside big Hollywood spenders like Netflix, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Time Warner's HBO.Despite the growing competition in the hot original content space, a move to invest in its own programming would make sense for several reasons.The most immediate reason for Apple to invest in original video content is to better differentiate its Apple Music service, which Apple has recently started rolling out original TV shows on. Launched two years ago, Apple Music has proven to be a worthwhile investment for Apple, attracting 27 million paying subscribers. Sure, Apple's music service is still well behind Spotify, which boasts 60 million paying subscribers, but the fact that it has been able to garner 27 million paying subscribers in such a short time easily justifies further investment in the service.By adding original video programming to Apple Music, the service will stand out from chief music-streaming competitor Spotify, which is primarily a music service. Further, original Apple content would give Apple more of a unique value proposition to attract more first-time paying users. Citing "people familiar with the matter," WSJ said Apple could be planning to acquire and produce as many as 10 television shows with its $1 billion budget.But original video content is likely about more than its Apple Music service. Over the long haul, original content could create an entirely new pillar for Apple's business, further entrenching customers into the sticky Apple ecosystem of hardware, software, and services.As Amazon invests aggressively in video, it has already seen success in making original video programming a key component of the overall attractiveness of its Prime membership, so much so that the company is increasing its video content budget from an estimated $2.7 billion in 2015 to approximately $4.5 billion in 2017, according to eMarketer. By launching its own original content, Apple could similarly help bolster the overall attractiveness of the Apple ecosystem, driving more customer loyalty and spending.It's easy to see why Apple would want to build out its services offerings even further. Apple has witnessed the power of recurring subscriptions across its business -- whether they are Apple Music subscriptions, or subscriptions to popular apps like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO NOW. By the end of its third fiscal quarter of 2017, the number of paid subscriptions across Apple's services offerings hit more than 185 million, up 20 million in just 90 days. Further, Apple's services segment, in general, is on fire. In the trailing 12 months, the segment has generated $27.8 billion of revenue, up over 20% year over year.Of course, there's always risk to new initiatives like this. For instance, overall value added to Apple's business from original content may not end up exceeding production costs. Further, Apple's product- and software-driven culture could clash with Hollywood, ultimately creating new problems that could distract leadership from Apple's bread and butter: the iPhone. Fortunately, however, much of this risk is mitigated by the fact that $1 billion is nearly play-money for Apple. Not only does Apple have $261.5 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, but it is currently generating over $50 billion a year in free cash flow. Considering how original video content could not only differentiate Apple Music, but also reinforce the overall strength of Apple's ecosystem, there's no reason Apple shouldn't drop $1 billion on content over the next year. The market for original content has largely been proven -- and Apple's massive cash hoard allows the company to make big bets without creating much risk for shareholders.
